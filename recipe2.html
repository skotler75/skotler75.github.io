  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li> Boil the penne in a large pot of water, according to package instructions.</li>
      <li> Meanwhile heat the 2 tsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season both sides of the chicken breast halves with salt and pepper, then cook in the skillet for 3 to 4 minutes per side, until cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet to a plate, cover each chicken breast with 1 tsp of prepared basil pesto, then cover the plate loosely with tin foil.</li>
      <li> In the same skillet add the butter and garlic and stir, to loosen any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Once the butter is melted add the cream cheese and whisk until the cream cheese is mostly melted. Reduce the heat to medium low and gradually add the cream to the skillet, while continuing to whisk.</li>
      <li> Once the mixture is smooth add in the parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and sun dried tomatoes. Whisk until melted and smooth again. Drain the cooked pasta and add it directly to the pan with the sauce. Stir to coat and then top with the basil pesto chicken breasts. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
